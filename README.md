# deploy-context
deploy context based on cucumber feature and Chef cookbooks

***
This project is intend to be a essai about all my knowledge on project lifecycle and management.

Chef is a discovery to me as I try over the past years lot of free scripting solution to be as more Infrastructure as code as possible even before I intend to be a software enginneer, back in 2006. The name of Martin Foller doesn't ring any bell on my though back there and I was taking care as volunteer of a network of 10 computers for my community center.

It's only almost 10 years after that I discover Chef for the first time.
Ruby was out of my though before learning how Chef work.

Also, I know from my Univerity courses on programming video games that tests are very important and they are mostly used for unitary and integration as by the time I achieve it, Devops and BDD concept was just born.

Probably you are questionnning yourself on what is BDD. Behavior-driven development, it's how he is named. This concept goes in harmony with the double-tests concept where it came first in play. Writting down the test first is helpfull to keep the progression without losing the libraries you already created. Also the integration with the actual project are easy to use and allow the focus on the actual progression and the actual action propose by the library.

Still, it doesn't complete a trouble that I have: When do we push our project up in the public

That's where Cucumber came in play with an acceptance test framework where combine with Chef allow that integration.



However, I still have lot to learn and a lot to remember mainly as how fast the community grow up.

So this is my legacy over all my years offer to open source community, hoping that you will have as much fun as I do to made it, use it and develop it ;)
